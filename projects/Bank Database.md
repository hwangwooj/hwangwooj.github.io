This bank database project is the first project from ICS 212 class. The purpose of this project is to make a bank database program which is able to add, delete, or display the bank account information to the user. Bank account information such as account number, name, address are stored in each record using one of important data structures ‘linked lists’. The user can access to the records which are stored in the database using various functions such as addRecord, printRecord, or deleteRecord. 

Although this program looks trivial, some important aspects of data structure and C language were integrated in order to create this program. For example, each record is stored as a form of list and connected to each other using pointers. Designing the program and dealing with the data stored in  linked lists made me learn lots of things about data structure and C language.
