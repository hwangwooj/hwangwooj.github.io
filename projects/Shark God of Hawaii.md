For this project, I had to choose a topic which is related to Hawaiian legend/myth and give presentation in front of other students on campus. This project would be one of the most hard working projects of mine when I was a KCC student. The most difficult part of this project was to search for sources that are relevant to the topic. I spent most of the time searching for enough sources and quite succeeded  in gathering enough of them.

My English got improved a lot thanks to this class, especially during this project. I worked very hard from choosing the topic to completing a final paper. The whole procedures of this project helped me work better on another project afterward. I hope I can work on some awesome projects regarding computer science in the near future.
