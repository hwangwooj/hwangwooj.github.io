Manoa munchies™ is a directory for students to find food on campus they might enjoy based on their preferences. Here they are able to discover a selection of vendors as well as their information on hours of operation and location. Being a team of hardworking college students ourselves, we thought that every student should have a reliable and pleasant experience of finding places where they can eat. Because after all, food is what brings us together and keeps us going in this tough college life.

For this team project in ICS314 class, my four other classmates and I worked together for a website. I mainly contributed to editing more functionalities in Vendor card such as displaying menu items associated with each vendor. Through this project, I was able to experience a teamwork software engineering project with my classmates and learned how entire source files/codes work collectively to complete a website.
